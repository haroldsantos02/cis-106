1. What are the advantages of open source? - Lesser hardware costs High-quality software. No vendor lock-in. Integrated management.

2. What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source? "Free software" refers to software that respects the freedom and community of its users. It roughly translates to the users' ability to execute, copy, distribute, study, update, and develop the program.
3. Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version?The flexibility to run the program for any purpose and on any number of machines may significantly reduce costs, which is often what drives a company's decision to embrace open-source software.
4. Watch the following video: Why is free software important? Richard Stall man - in INT's ENLIGHTENMENT MINUTES. Do you agree with Richard Stall man? Do you disagree? Explain your answer. - To me, the concept of Free Software and Open Source is similar to that of scientific study. Everyone can get engaged and make a difference in their town. Linux, for example, is the largest single collaborative endeavor in human history (as for now).
One can charge people for their software - in a way, it's also a form of freedom - but it shouldn't be the only motivation to create such program in the first place.
